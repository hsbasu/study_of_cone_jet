\subsection{Objective}
\subsection{Motivations}
( Benefits- economical)
\subsection{Financial}
(Can be in terms of efficiency although currency numbers are more preferred).
\subsection{Work impact}
Brief explanation of work impact ( Broad area)
\clearpage

\section{Project substance}
This should include 2 small paragraphs of brief methodology i.e., what is my interest, what I am trying to achieve through my experimental setup/numerical scheme.
\clearpage

\section{Contents of research}
\subsection{Previous studies}
\subsection{Limitations}
\subsection{Experience to achieve results}
(You have studied literature and now procuring a experimental setup, with this you have to convince the readers that you are capable of achieving results. It should be valid).
\subsection{Details about research}
(All the study parameters which I will be studying and varying)
\subsection{Challenges}
(Which I will be facing while doing my experimental project)
\clearpage
\section{Methodology}
(Detailed experimental and analytical process to be adopted or a flowchart to defend same including brief explanations).\\
Mention the parameters selected for study, how you are going to change them and why?...for each objective and also show analysis.
\section{Work plan}
Make it in two parts. One is timeline where your plan is divided in terms of months and second is here your plan is divided in terms of years.
\section{Anticipate results and potential contribution}
This should include both short term and long term results. Also there should be a link directing impact of short term results on long term results like impact on society or monetary gains for some section of people or some countries.
